# Personalized Learning - Introduction to Physical AI

## Overview

This section provides personalized content adapted to different experience levels. Select your background to receive content tailored to your current knowledge and learning needs.

## For Different Experience Levels

### Beginner Level

#### Simplified Explanation
Physical AI is like giving a brain to a robot. Instead of just following pre-programmed instructions, the robot can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions based on what it senses. Think of it like a smart vacuum cleaner that can navigate around your furniture - it's a simple form of Physical AI.

#### Learning Approach
