# Project Description: Capstone Project

## Overview

The capstone project integrates all concepts learned in Modules 1-6 to create a comprehensive Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics system. Students will design, implement, and validate a complete robotic system that demonstrates proficiency in all covered areas.

## Project Scope

### Core Components
- Physical AI principles and implementation
- ROS 2-based communication and control
- Gazebo simulation environment
- NVIDIA Isaac platform integration
- Humanoid robotics kinematics and control
- Vision-Language-Action system integration

### Learning Objectives
- Synthesize knowledge from all modules
- Implement complex multi-component systems
- Apply safety and ethical considerations
- Demonstrate system integration capabilities

## Project Deliverables

### Technical Deliverables
- Complete working system
- Source code and documentation
- Performance evaluation
- Safety analysis

### Documentation Deliverables
- System design documentation
- Implementation guide
- Evaluation report
- Lessons learned summary

## Timeline and Milestones

The project should be completed over 2-3 weeks with regular milestone check-ins and iterative development.
