# Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook! This comprehensive guide will take you through the fundamentals of Physical AI, from basic concepts to advanced implementations with ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to the field of artificial intelligence that is embodied in physical systems, particularly robots. Unlike traditional AI that operates in digital spaces, Physical AI must navigate, interact with, and adapt to the real physical world with all its complexities, uncertainties, and dynamic properties.

Physical AI combines several key disciplines:

- **Robotics**: The design, construction, and operation of robots
- **Computer Vision**: Enabling robots to perceive and understand visual information
- **Machine Learning**: Allowing robots to learn from experience and adapt
- **Control Theory**: Managing the movement and behavior of physical systems
- **Sensor Integration**: Combining data from multiple sensors for perception

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Define Physical AI and distinguish it from traditional AI
- Understand the key components and challenges of Physical AI systems
- Identify the relationship between Physical AI and robotics
- Recognize the applications and potential of Physical AI
- Understand safety considerations in Physical AI development

## Target Audience

This textbook is designed for:

- **Students**: Undergraduate and graduate students studying robotics, AI, or computer science
- **Educators**: Instructors teaching courses on robotics or AI
- **Engineers**: Professionals working in robotics, automation, or AI
- **Researchers**: Scientists exploring Physical AI and robotics applications

## Course Structure

The textbook is organized into six core modules:

1. **Module 1**: Introduction to Physical AI (this module)
2. **Module 2**: ROS 2 Fundamentals
3. **Module 3**: Gazebo Simulation
4. **Module 4**: NVIDIA Isaac Platform
5. **Module 5**: Humanoid Robotics

- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTICE**:
Physical AI systems interact with the real world and can pose risks to people, property, and the environment. Always follow safety protocols:

- Test all code in simulation before deploying to physical robots
- Implement appropriate safety limits and emergency stops
- Never exceed specified operational parameters
- Follow all manufacturer guidelines for hardware

## Getting Started

This textbook includes several types of content to enhance your learning:

- **Theory**: Core concepts and principles
- **Code Examples**: Practical implementations in ROS 2, Python, and other frameworks
- **Lab Exercises**: Hands-on activities to practice concepts
- **Quizzes**: Knowledge checks to assess your understanding
